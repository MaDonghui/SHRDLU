SHRDLU is an adventure game based around natural language parsing (inspired by Winograd's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU">SHRDLU</a>). It is an experiment, so, I am not expecting the resulting game to be an amazing game, but just an exploration of the posibilities of this type of AI system in a game.

Source code and a playable demo will be uploaded soon, but a demonstration video can be found here: https://youtu.be/8FNBTs2yv4s
