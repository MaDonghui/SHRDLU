SHRDLU is an adventure game based around natural language parsing (inspired by Winograd's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU">SHRDLU</a>). It is an experiment, so, I am not expecting the resulting game to be an amazing game, but just an exploration of the posibilities of this type of AI system in a game.

Source code and a playable demo will be uploaded soon, but a demonstration video of Demo v1.1 can be found here: https://youtu.be/8FNBTs2yv4s

# Development Notes

The game has been coded using <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, which is basically an typed version of JavaScript, which is much more natural to code in. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, and thus the game can run in any web browser that supports JavaScript. Although in principle any modern browser should do, I usually test using Safari and Chrome. The game is built in plain TypeScript, and no additional libraries have been used. 

Concerning the visual style, I chose a 256x192 screen resolution with a 16 color palette. These were the specs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX">MSX</a> computer, which was the 8bit computer with which I learned how to code when I was a kid.
